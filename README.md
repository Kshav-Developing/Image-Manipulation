# Image-Manipulation
This repository is all about using your photoshop skills and python to edit, convert and crop images. The module used here is PIL (pillow). You can apply filters and many more things to manipulate images. Good luck learning all of it!

You might find everything randomly, however, I have renamed all these files with chapter number to learn efficiently. You have to create your own path file, here I have used - "photos\\pic.jpg", means I have saved a photo with name "pic.jpg" in a folder named as "photos". So you need to edit all those locations in your own laptop or PC. Image manipulation is a little bit complicated because you are unable to see the changes made by the computer behind. Now good luck with the tutorials!
